AB  - Two recent studies of eye closure triggered by intense luminance increase suggest that this behavior reflects the melanopsin-based retinal activity known to underlie photophobia, the pathological aversion to light (Kardon, 2012; Kaiser et al., 2021). Early studies of the photic blink reflex (PBR) are reviewed to help guide future research on this possible objective index of photophobia. Electromyographic recordings of the lid-closure muscle, orbicularis oculi, reveal distinct bursts with typical onset latencies of 50 and 80 ms, R50 and R80, respectively. The latter component appears to be especially sensitive to visual signals from intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) and to prior trigeminal nociceptive stimuli. The authors argue that the R80's function, in addition to protecting the eyeballs from physical contact, is to shape the upper and lower eyelids into a narrow slit to restrict incoming light. This serves to prevent retinal bleaching or injury, while allowing continued visual function.

AB  - Sneezing is a poorly understood, protective reflex response. It's characterized by the following sequence: eye closure, inspiration, glottic closure, forced expiration with sudden glottic opening, and release of an elevated intrathoracic pressure creating a flow of explosive air through the nose.(1) Studies have indicated an anatomic sneezing area of the brainstem corresponding to the central recipient zone of the nasal sensory neurons in the lateral medulla.(2) The traditional pathophysiology of the sneeze is thought to begin by stimulation of the distal branches of the trigeminal nerve within the nasal mucosa. Afferent neural stimuli are transmitted to the trigeminal ganglion and then the lateral medulla. The efferent phase then begins, giving rise to the sneezing sequence described earlier.(1) In addition to direct nasal irritation, sneezing has been shown to be triggered by several other causes (Table 1). This suggests that alternative mechanisms of sneeze induction other than direct nasal stimulation exist. We report a case of a 34-year-old man undergoing an awake craniotomy for a recurrent World Health Organization grade 2 oligodendroglioma (IDH-mutant, 1p19q-codeleted, ATRX preserved). During the operation we elicited a sneeze response on 3 occasions on stimulation of the olfactory nerve (Video 1). Although we cannot completely exclude costimulation of the sensory trigeminal terminations in the anterior fossa floor, the actual sneezing occurred during tumor peeling away from the arachnoid surface overlaying the olfactory nerve. This suggests a potential accessory route of sneeze stimulation involving the olfactory nerve distinct from the previously described trigemino-related, autonomic (sympathetic and parasympathetic systems) and psychogenic etiologies.

AB  - Second only to headache, photophobia is the most debilitating symptom reported by people with migraine. While the melanopsin-containing intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) are thought to play a role, how cone and melanopsin signals are integrated in this pathway to produce visual discomfort is poorly understood. We studied 60 people: 20 without headache and 20 each with interictal photophobia from migraine with or without visual aura. Participants viewed pulses of spectral change that selectively targeted melanopsin, the cones, or both and rated the degree of visual discomfort produced by these stimuli while we recorded pupil responses. We examined the data within a model that describes how cone and melanopsin signals are weighted and combined at the level of the retina and how this combined signal is transformed into a rating of discomfort or pupil response. Our results indicate that people with migraine do not differ from headache-free controls in the manner in which melanopsin and cone signals are combined. Instead, people with migraine demonstrate an enhanced response to integrated ipRGC signals for discomfort. This effect of migraine is selective for ratings of visual discomfort, in that an enhancement of pupil responses was not seen in the migraine group, nor were group differences found in surveys of other behaviors putatively linked to ipRGC function (chronotype, seasonal sensitivity, presence of a photic sneeze reflex). By revealing a dissociation in the amplification of discomfort vs. pupil response, our findings suggest a postretinal alteration in processing of ipRGC signals for photophobia in migraine.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of slit lamp breath shields to prevent droplet spray from a simulated sneeze. DESIGN: Experimental study to test effectiveness of personal protective equipment. METHODS: The nozzle of a spray gun was adjusted to angularly disperse a mist of colored dye that approximated a patient sneezing on a dimensionally accurate cardboard slit lamp model. We tested the designs of six commercially available breath shields, and one breath shield repurposed from a plastic container lid. Each breath shield was sprayed in a standardized fashion three times and the amount of overspray compared with no shield was quantified. The surface area that was sprayed was calculated using Adobe Photoshop's color range function. The average percentage of overspray of each breath shield was computed in comparison to the control. RESULTS: The breath shields ranged in surface area from 116-1254 cm(2) and the amount of overspray varied from 54% to virtually none. Larger breath shields offered better protection than smaller ones. Breath shields attached to the objective lens arm were a better barrier than those hung by the oculars of comparable size. A repurposed plastic lid breath shield was 513cm(2), was slightly curved toward the examiner's face, and allowed only 2% overspray. The largest breath shield (1254 cm(2)) hung near the oculars and prevented essentially all the overspray. CONCLUSION: The performance of different designs of breath shields is variable. Even high functioning shields should be used in conjunction with personal protective equipment including masks, goggles and gloves, and handwashing. Ideally patients should also wear a cloth mask during all slit lamp exams.

AB  - Photic sneeze reflex (PSR) is an interesting but yet mysterious phenotype featured by individuals' response of sneezing in exposure to bright light. To uncover the underlying genetic markers (single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs), a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted exclusively in a Chinese population of 3417 individuals (PSR prevalence at 25.6%), and reproducibly identified both a replicative rs10427255 on 2q22.3 and a novel locus of rs1032507 on 3p12.1 in various effect models (additive, as well as dominant and recessive). Minor alleles respectively contributed to increased or reduced risk for PSR with odds ratio (95% confidence interval) at 1.68 ([1.50, 1.88]) for rs10427255 and 0.65 ([0.58, 0.72]) for rs1032507. The two independent SNPs were intergenic, and collectively enhanced PSR classification by lifting the area-under-curve value in ROC curve to 0.657. Together with previous GWAS in other populations, the result substantiated the polygenic and non-ethnicity-specific nature behind the PSR phenotype.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sneezing is an almost universal daily phenomenon as a reflex to evacuate irritants from the nasal cavities. An autonomic-controlled buildup of intrathoracic pressure against a closed glottis followed by sudden release results in a burst of 1 kPa of air through the upper airway. Active intervention to limit a sneeze can be deleterious. Closure of the airway during a sneeze can result in over 20 times the airway pressures resulting in a variety of untoward events. This review summarizes all reported injuries that occurred as the result of a sneeze. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review is to summarize the risks of closed-airway sneezing and determine if there are any trends which can help understand such injuries. METHODS: A comprehensive literature review was performed from 1948 to 2018 to identify all reports of sneeze-related injuries. Information was compiled from reports to gain insights into comorbidities and risk factors for sneeze injuries. RESULTS: There were 52 unique reports of sneeze-related injuries in the literature that were categorized into 6 areas of injury: intrathoracic, laryngeal/pharyngeal, ocular/orbital, intracranial/neurological, otologic, and other. The mean age of subjects who suffered a sneeze injury was 40 years old (range: 15-84 years), with 81% being male gender. Thirty percent had a risk factor for injury of prior trauma (5) or respiratory compromise (5). CONCLUSION: A variety of injuries can occur during a sneeze, especially when a closed-airway sneeze is attempted, and high Valsalva pressure is transmitted to the other systems. Men are more at risk for these injuries with the majority occurring in patients with no known risk factor. When triggered, a sneeze should be allowed to proceed without intervention to prevent associated injuries.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Photic sneeze syndrome (PSS) is a condition that causes sneezing when the eye is exposed to sudden bright light. Because alterations in the parasympathetic and trigeminal nerve systems have been implicated in PSS, and such systems are involved in migraine and stress-related disorders, we examined the possible associations of PSS with migraine and psychological distress. METHODS: The presence of PSS and migraine was examined in 11 840 participants from the general population using a self-report questionnaire. Psychological distress was assessed by the 6-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K6). RESULTS: The overall prevalence of PSS was 3.1%. Individuals with PSS were more likely to suffer from migraine (odds ratio = 1.97, P = 2.18 x 10(-9) ), clinically relevant psychological distress (K6 score >/= 5: odds ratio = 1.40, P = 0.00143), and severe psychological distress (K6 score >/= 13: odds ratio = 1.49, P = 0.0486). Overall, K6 scores were significantly higher in those with PSS than in those without (P = 0.000013). Analysis controlling for sex and the presence of migraine showed that PSS was associated with higher K6 scores irrespective of sex or the presence of migraine. CONCLUSIONS: The low prevalence of PSS identified in the present study may be due to the inadequate ability of the self-report questionnaire to identify PSS. Despite such limitation, the present study suggests that individuals with PSS are more likely to suffer from migraine and psychological distress than those without PSS. PSS may be a potential target for the research of migraine and stress-related disorders.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review clinical and pre-clinical evidence supporting the role of visual pathways, from the eye to the cortex, in the development of photophobia in headache disorders. BACKGROUND: Photophobia is a poorly understood light-induced phenomenon that emerges in a variety of neurological and ophthalmological conditions. Over the years, multiple mechanisms have been proposed to explain its causes; however, scarce research and lack of systematic assessment of photophobia in patients has made the search for answers quite challenging. In the field of headaches, significant progress has been made recently on how specific visual networks contribute to photophobia features such as light-induced intensification of headache, increased perception of brightness and visual discomfort, which are frequently experienced by migraineurs. Such progress improved our understanding of the phenomenon and points to abnormal processing of light by both cone/rod-mediated image-forming and melanopsin-mediated non-image-forming visual pathways, and the consequential transfer of photic signals to multiple brain regions involved in sensory, autonomic and emotional regulation. CONCLUSION: Photophobia phenotype is diverse, and the relative contribution of visual, trigeminal and autonomic systems may depend on the disease it emerges from. In migraine, photophobia could result from photic activation of retina-driven pathways involved in the regulation of homeostasis, making its association with headache more complex than previously thought.

AB  - Photophobia may arise from various causes and frequently accompanies numerous ocular diseases. In modern highly illuminated world, complaints about greater photosensitivity to blue light increasingly appear. However, the pathophysiology of photophobia is still debated. In the present work, we investigated in vivo the role of various neural pathways potentially implicated in blue-light aversion. Moreover, we studied the light-induced neuroinflammatory processes on the ocular surface and in the trigeminal pathways. Adult male C57BL/6J mice were exposed either to blue (400-500 nm) or to yellow (530-710 nm) LED light (3 h, 6 mW/cm(2)). Photosensitivity was measured as the time spent in dark or illuminated parts of the cage. Pharmacological treatments were applied: topical instillation of atropine, pilocarpine or oxybuprocaine, intravitreal injection of lidocaine, norepinephrine or "blocker" of the visual photoreceptor transmission, and intraperitoneal injection of a melanopsin antagonist. Clinical evaluations (ocular surface state, corneal mechanical sensitivity and tear quantity) were performed directly after exposure to light and after 3 days of recovery in standard light conditions. Trigeminal ganglia (TGs), brainstems and retinas were dissected out and conditioned for analyses. Mice demonstrated strong aversion to blue but not to yellow light. The only drug that significantly decreased the blue-light aversion was the intraperitoneally injected melanopsin antagonist. After blue-light exposure, dry-eye-related inflammatory signs were observed, notably after 3 days of recovery. In the retina, we observed the increased immunoreactivity for GFAP, ATF3, and Iba1; these data were corroborated by RT-qPCR. Moreover, retinal visual and non-visual photopigments distribution was altered. In the trigeminal pathway, we detected the increased mRNA expression of cFOS and ATF3 as well as alterations in cytokines' levels. Thus, the wavelength-dependent light aversion was mainly mediated by melanopsin-containing cells, most likely in the retina. Other potential pathways of light reception were also discussed. The phototoxic message was transmitted to the trigeminal system, inducing both inflammation at the ocular surface and stress in the retina. Further investigations of retina-TG connections are needed.

AB  - Background: The photic sneeze reflex (autosomal dominant) is a condition that causes sneezing in response to numerous stimuli, such as looking at bright lights or periocular (surrounding the eyeball) injection. Unexpected or sudden sneezing during injection can be a dangerous side effect in periocular injection, in which abrupt head movement may cause globe injury. Aims: We intended to evaluate the efficacy of adding fentanyl, dexmedetomidine, and antihistamines on the incidence of the sneeze reflex associated with propofol sedation during periocular local anesthesia injections. Settings and Design: Our study was a randomized, prospective, double-blinded and controlled clinical study. Patients and Methods: This study was conducted in Ain Shams and Fayoum university hospitals at the ophthalmic surgery department. After obtaining approval from our universities ethical committee and written informed valid consents from the patients, 90 patients were included in this study. The study population included patients of both sex, ASA grade 1 and 2, in the age ranging from 18-65 years. Patients were scheduled for cataract extraction surgeries and received peribulbar block. Then patients were randomly divided into three groups (30 patients each) using a computer- generated table of random numbers. Patients were preoxygenated with supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula, all 90 patients received intravenous propofol 1mg.kg- 1 bolus for sedation and were randomized to receive adjunctive drug 2 to 4 minutes prior to propofol injection: 30 patients received intravenous fentanyl 1 mumg.kg(-1) (Group F), 30 patients received dexmedetomidine 1mumg.kg(-1) (Group D), and 30 patients received antihistamine (pheniramine 22.75 mg) (Group H). The same local anesthetic admixture, consisting of 5 mL 2% lidocaine with 90 IU hyaluronidase, combined with 5 mL 0.5% plain bupivacaine in a 10-mL syringe at room temperature was administered to all patients using peribulbar block technique. A masked observer (surgeon or anesthesia assistant) recorded whether the patient had a sneezing event. Continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring was performed intraoperatively. Intraoperative and postoperative medication side effects were recorded including bradycardia (HR <55 beats/min), hypotension (MAP <50 mmHg sustained for >10 min), oxygen desaturation (SpO2<90%), nausea, vomiting and prolonged sedation using Ramsay Sedation Score (RSS). Statistical Analysis Used: Student's t-test and Chi-square test were used for analysis. Results: The demographic data of the three study groups revealed non-significant differences between the three study groups as regards age, sex distribution, and the duration of surgery. No patient was excluded after inclusion to the study. All patients were able to complete the entire study and their data were included in the final analysis. Five events of sneezing had occurred in 90 patients. Two in (D) group and three in (H) group with is no statistically significant difference between the three groups as regard sneezing. Bradycardia, hypotension and sedation had occurred significantly in group (D) compared to group (F) and group (D). No patient suffered from nausea, vomiting or oxygen desaturation in all studied groups. No statistically significant difference as regards patient satisfaction between the three studied groups. Conclusion: Fentanyl, dexmedetomidine and antihistamines with propofol sedation suppress photic sneeze reflex during peribulbar block.

AB  - The human pupillary light response is driven by all classes of photoreceptors in the human eye-the three classes of cones, the rods, and the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) expressing the photopigment melanopsin. These photoreceptor classes have distinct but overlapping spectral tuning, and even a monochromatic light with a wavelength matched to the peak spectral sensitivity of a given photoreceptor will stimulate all photoreceptors. The method of silent substitution uses pairs of lights ("metamers") to selectively stimulate a given class of photoreceptors while keeping the activation of all others constant. In this primer, we describe the method of silent substitution and provide an overview of studies that have used it to examine inputs to the human pupillary light response.

AB  - Photic sneeze syndrome (PSS) is characterized by a tendency to sneeze when the eye is exposed to bright light. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with PSS in Caucasian populations. We performed a GWAS on PSS in Japanese individuals who responded to a web-based survey and provided saliva samples. After quality control, genotype data of 210,086 SNPs in 11,409 individuals were analyzed. The overall prevalence of PSS was 3.2%. Consistent with previous reports, SNPs at 3p12.1 were associated with PSS at genome-wide significance (p < 5.0 x 10(-8)). Furthermore, two novel loci at 9q34.2 and 4q35.2 reached suggestive significance (p < 5.0 x 10(-6)). Our data also provided evidence supporting the two additional SNPs on 2q22.3 and 9q33.2 reportedly associated with PSS. Our study reproduced previous findings in Caucasian populations and further suggested novel PSS loci in the Japanese population.

AB  - The sneezing reflex is a common phenomenon in human beings and animals. Until now largely uninvestigated sneezing phenomenon is the photic sneeze reflex, also known as the ACHOO (Autosomal Cholinergic Helio-Ophtalmologic Outburst). This light induced sneezing reflex is triggered by a bright light like the sun but also by artificial light. In former publications the prevalence of this phenomenon in the population is specified up to 35 % and can result in a potential endangerment in numerous everyday situations as driving a car or controlling an airplane. In our present study we interviewed 1042 patients in the Department of Otorhinolaryngology of the Saarland University Hospital using standardized questionnaires to analyse epidemiological data as age, gender and known diseases. Additionally, the questionnaire focused on the occurrence of sneezing events, extend of sneezing, potential triggers, and methods of evasion. In our data analysis, we were able to show a high prevalence of the ACHOO in 57 % of our cohort, suffering from regular light induced sneezing events. Excluding subjects reporting only occasional sneezing events our results were comparable to findings in literature. As expected a familial disposition was observed, additionally tobacco smoking correlated with light induced sneezing events. Analyzing a large cohort, we were able to demonstrate that the prevalence of the ACHOO in the german population may be higher than expected. Taken into account the potential hazard caused by this phenomenon, further investigations should identify the pathophysiologic pathway.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: In patients reporting acute headache after sneezing or coughing, rupture of an intracranial aneurysm is the first diagnosis to be considered. Sneezing, however, might also be a trigger for migraine attacks, as exemplified in our case. CASE REPORT: We describe a patient who suffered 3 headache attacks after sneezing, each fulfilling criteria of migraine without aura. Sneezing as a specific trigger for migraine has not been described before. DISCUSSION: The differential diagnosis of acute headache after sneezing (eg, subarachnoid hemorrhage and reversible cerebral vasoconstriction), and the differences between migraine after sneezing and "benign cough headache" are discussed. We conclude that a pathophysiological association between migraine and sneezing might exist and hypothesize on underlying mechanisms.

AB  - Bright light can cause ocular discomfort and/or pain; however, the mechanism linking luminance to trigeminal nerve activity is not known. In this study we identify a novel reflex circuit necessary for bright light to excite nociceptive neurons in superficial laminae of trigeminal subnucleus caudalis (Vc/C1). Vc/C1 neurons encoded light intensity and displayed a long delay (>10s) for activation. Microinjection of lidocaine into the eye or trigeminal root ganglion (TRG) inhibited light responses completely, whereas topical application onto the ocular surface had no effect. These findings indicated that light-evoked Vc/C1 activity was mediated by an intraocular mechanism and transmission through the TRG. Disrupting local vasomotor activity by intraocular microinjection of the vasoconstrictive agents, norepinephrine or phenylephrine, blocked light-evoked neural activity, whereas ocular surface or intra-TRG microinjection of norepinephrine had no effect. Pupillary muscle activity did not contribute since light-evoked responses were not altered by atropine. Microinjection of lidocaine into the superior salivatory nucleus diminished light-evoked Vc/C1 activity and lacrimation suggesting that increased parasympathetic outflow was critical for light-evoked responses. The reflex circuit also required input through accessory visual pathways since both Vc/C1 activity and lacrimation were prevented by local blockade of the olivary pretectal nucleus. These findings support the hypothesis that bright light activates trigeminal nerve activity through an intraocular mechanism driven by a luminance-responsive circuit and increased parasympathetic outflow to the eye.

AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the frequency of sneezing among patients receiving intravenous sedation and periocular local anesthetic for oculoplastic procedures in a single center. To identify potential risk factors involved. DESIGN: Prospective, consecutive, interventional case series in a single tertiary-referral oculoplastic unit. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 294 patients undergoing 314 isolated oculoplastic procedures, performed under intravenous sedation with periocular local anesthetic from November 2007 to November 2008. METHODS: Prospective data collection on patient demographics, history of photic sneezing, intravenous sedative, depth of sedation, nasal oxygen, and periocular infiltration site. Standard local anesthetic was used in all cases, but the intravenous sedation was at the discretion of the attending anesthesiologist (7 in total). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sneezing or attempted sneezing within 5 minutes of injection of the local anesthetic, as determined by agreed observation between attending staff. RESULTS: Sneezing was observed in 16% of cases. No association was found between sneezing and patient age or presence of nasal oxygen. A weakly positive association was observed with male gender (55% sneezers vs. 37% non-sneezers, P = 0.03, relative risk [RR] = 1.5, confidence interval [CI], 1.1-2.0), bilateral infiltration (65% vs. 40%, P = 0.005, RR = 1.6, CI, 1.2-2.1), and upper eyelid infiltration (73% vs. 54%, P = 0.01, RR = 1.4, CI, 1.1-1.7). Photic sneezing was described in 47% of sneezers and 19% of non-sneezers (P = 0.0004, RR = 2.6, CI, 1.6-4.0). Because propofol was given to 95% of patients, no association with sneezing could be ascertained. However, opioid derivatives were found to be protective (12% vs. 43%, P<0.0001, RR = 0.3, CI, 0.1-0.6), whereas midazolam doubled the risk of sneezing (45% vs. 22%, P = 0.0008, RR = 2.1, CI, 1.4-3.0). Deep sedation (Ramsay score 5-6) also strongly increased the sneeze risk (65% vs. 23%, P<0.0001, RR = 2.8, CI, 2.1-3.8). CONCLUSIONS: Propofol-based intravenous sedation, in combination with periocular local anesthetic injections, induces sneezing in approximately one sixth of general oculoplastic cases. Male gender, a history of photic sneezing, bilateral or upper eyelid infiltration, deep sedation, and the concurrent administration of midazolam all increased the risk, whereas adjunctive opioid use reduced the risk.

AB  - Despite the recent rapid growth in genome-wide data, much of human variation remains entirely unexplained. A significant challenge in the pursuit of the genetic basis for variation in common human traits is the efficient, coordinated collection of genotype and phenotype data. We have developed a novel research framework that facilitates the parallel study of a wide assortment of traits within a single cohort. The approach takes advantage of the interactivity of the Web both to gather data and to present genetic information to research participants, while taking care to correct for the population structure inherent to this study design. Here we report initial results from a participant-driven study of 22 traits. Replications of associations (in the genes OCA2, HERC2, SLC45A2, SLC24A4, IRF4, TYR, TYRP1, ASIP, and MC1R) for hair color, eye color, and freckling validate the Web-based, self-reporting paradigm. The identification of novel associations for hair morphology (rs17646946, near TCHH; rs7349332, near WNT10A; and rs1556547, near OFCC1), freckling (rs2153271, in BNC2), the ability to smell the methanethiol produced after eating asparagus (rs4481887, near OR2M7), and photic sneeze reflex (rs10427255, near ZEB2, and rs11856995, near NR2F2) illustrates the power of the approach.

AB  - Sneezing is a protective reflex, and is sometimes a sign of various medical conditions. Sneezing has been a remarkable sign throughout the history. In Asia and Europe, superstitions regarding sneezing extend through a wide range of races and countries, and it has an ominous significance. Although sneezing is a protective reflex response, little else is known about it. A sneeze (or sternutation) is expulsion of air from the lungs through the nose and mouth, most commonly caused by the irritation of the nasal mucosa. Sneezing can further be triggered through sudden exposure to bright light, a particularly full stomach and physical stimulants of the trigeminal nerve, as a result of central nervous system pathologies such as epilepsy, posterior inferior cerebellar artery syndrome or as a symptom of psychogenic pathologies. In this first comprehensive review of the sneeze reflex in the English literature, we aim to review the pathophysiology, etiology, diagnosis, treatment and complications of sneezing.

AB  - PURPOSE: A sneeze reflex may occur after propofol sedation and during periocular injections. Unexpected movement from sneezing can result in needle injury to the globe or optic nerve, or hematoma. We investigate the efficacy of concomitant fentanyl or alfentanil in reducing sneezing following propofol and during periocular injections. METHODS: Our prospective, randomized study included 81 adult patients undergoing conscious sedation prior to periocular injection of local anesthesia. All patients received propofol and were randomized to propofol only (25 patients), propofol plus midazolam (14 patients), propofol plus opioid (31 patients), propofol plus midazolam and opioid (11 patients). Periocular injection of local anesthetic was given in the usual manner. The main outcome measure was sneezing. Patients were also assessed for cardiorespiratory parameters, analgesia, and adverse side effects of sedatives. RESULTS: Of the patients who received no opioid, 17 of 39 (43.6%) sneezed. Of the patients who received an opioid, 0 of 42 sneezed (p < 0.0001 by Fisher exact two-tailed test). Among subjects receiving no opioids, midazolam was associated with a higher incidence of the sneeze reflex, but this was not quite statistically significant (p = 0.09). No adverse cardiorespiratory events were noted and analgesia was universally adequate. CONCLUSIONS: Fentanyl or alfentanil suppressed sneezing after propofol sedation and eyelid anesthetic injection. These medications may prevent needle injury.

AB  - We describe a hitherto under-recognized curious response in some individuals: of sneezing in response either to sexual ideation or in response to orgasm. Our review suggests that it may be much more common than expected. We surmise that an indiscrete stimulation of the parasympathetic nervous system may be an underlying mechanism to explain this and other reported unusual triggers of sneezing.

AB  - Phototherapy has a profound immunosuppressive effect and is widely used for the treatment of immune mediated skin diseases. Phototherapy is able to inhibit immediate type hypersensitivity reaction in the skin. Intranasal phototherapy is a new approach for treatment of allergic rhinitis. In two open studies, 308 nm excimer laser and topical PUVA therapy efficiently inhibited clinical symptoms of allergic rhinitis. In a randomized, double-blind study combined low dose UVB, low dose UVA and visible light proved to be effective in reducing symptom scores for sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal itching and the total nasal score in ragweed allergic patients. Mechanism of action of phototherapy is complex, it reduces the antigen presenting capacity of dendritic cells, induces apoptosis of immune cells and inhibits synthesis and release of pro-inflammatory mediator from several cell types. Therefore, intranasal phototherapy may represent an alternative treatment of allergic rhinitis and other inflammatory and immune mediated mucosal diseases.

AB  - Experiments in cats have shown that sneezing can be induced using low intensity electrical current. This study focusses on answering the question whether the sneezing-reflex can also be induced in man through electrical stimulation, whether it is reproducible, and if the response can be abolished pharmacologically? Three healthy males were tested using intranasal stimulation in different parts of the nose using a current from an electric pulse generator. Using currents in the range 2-11 mA, it was possible to induce and reproduce sneezing in the anterior portion of the nose corresponding to the distribution area of the anterior ethmoidal nerve. In one tested subject, local anaesthetics applied to the mucous membranes of the nose abolished the sneezing. Sneeze reflex-reduction may be one way to reduce viral contamination between subjects. Further research could include pharmacological investigations to identify a sneeze-inhibiting substance with small risks for side effects that can be added to common cold nasal sprays.

AB  - Sneezing is a rarely explored symptom in neurological practice. In the cat, a sneeze evoking centre is located in the medulla. The existence of a sneezing centre has not been confirmed in humans. A case with abnormal sneezing secondary to a strategic infarct in the right latero-medullary region is presented. A 66 year old man suddenly presented paroxysmal sneezing followed by ataxia, right sided motor and sensory symptoms, and hoarseness. The application of stimuli to the right nasal fossa did not evoke sneezing nor the wish to sneeze. The same stimuli to the contralateral nasal fossa evoked normal sneezing. The preservation of the superficial sensitivity of the nasal fossa indicates that the lesion was localised in the hypothetical human sneezing centre, very close to the spinal trigeminal tract and nucleus. This centre appears to be bilateral and functionally independent on both sides.

AB  - The nose provides defensive and homeostatic functions requiring rapid responses to physical and chemical stimuli. As a result, it is armed with a complex nervous system that includes sensory, parasympathetic, and sympathetic nerves. Sensory nerves transmit signals from the mucosa, generating sensations, such as pruritus; motor reflexes, such as sneezing; and parasympathetic and sympathetic reflexes that affect the glandular and vascular nasal apparatuses. Reflexes directed to the nose are also generated by inputs from other body regions. Hence all symptoms that constitute the nosologic entity of rhinitis can be triggered through neural pathways. In addition, neural signals generated in the nose can influence distal physiology, such as that of the bronchial tree and the cardiovascular system. Neural function can be chronically upregulated in the presence of mucosal inflammation, acutely with an allergic reaction, or even in the absence of inflammation, as in cases of nonallergic rhinitis. Upregulation of the nasal nervous system can occur at various levels of the reflex pathways, resulting in exaggerated responses (neural hyperresponsiveness), as well as in increased capacity for generation of neurogenic inflammation, a phenomenon that depends on the release of neuropeptides on antidromic stimulation of nociceptive sensory nerves. The molecular mechanisms of hyperresponsiveness are not understood, but several inflammatory products appear to be playing a role. Neurotrophins, such as the nerve growth factor, are prime candidates as mediators of neural hyperresponsiveness. The many interactions between the nervous and immune systems contribute to nasal physiology but also to nasal disease.

AB  - Non-linear dose response relationships pose statistical challenges for their discovery. Even when an initial linear approximation is followed by other approaches, the results may be misleading and, possibly, preclude altogether the discovery of the nonlinear relationship under investigation. We review a variety of straightforward statistical approaches for detecting nonlinear relationships and discuss several factors that hinder their detection. Our specific context is that of epidemiologic studies of exposure-outcome associations and we focus on threshold and J-effect dose response relationships. The examples presented reveal that no single approach is universally appropriate; rather, these (and possibly other) nonlinearities require for their discovery a variety of both graphical and numeric techniques.

AB  - Sneeze is an ubiquitous phenomenon that happens to everyone. In spite of this, little attention has been paid to it, among medical literature in general, and even less in neurologic texts. A curious entity, called photic sneeze reflex, solar sneeze reflex, light sneeze reflex or autosomal dominant compelling helio-ophthalmic outburst syndrome, known perhaps since ancient Greek, has been scarcely described in the scientific literature, mainly as clinical notes and letters to the editor, but in a detailed way, we can find just a few reports. This reflex appears when subjects are exposed suddenly to intense sunlight and it consists of long incoercible sneeze bursts. It is usually ignored by its sufferers, who report it as a curiosity or a minor complaint, and its importance has been neglected in spite of its hereditary nature and its apparently high prevalence. We review the history, epidemiology, genetics, neuroanatomy, neurophysiology and physiopathology of this reflex hereditary response.

AB  - The orphan nuclear receptor Ear2 (Nr2f6) is transiently expressed in the rostral part of the rhombic lip in which the locus coeruleus (LC) arises. LC development, regulated by a signaling cascade (Mash1 --> Phox2b --> Phox2a), is disrupted in Ear2-/- embryos as revealed by an approximately threefold reduction in the number of Phox2a- and Phox2b-expressing LC progenitor cells. Mash1 expression in the rhombic lip, however, is unaffected, placing Ear2 in between Mash1 and Phox2a/b. Dopamine-beta-hydroxylase and tyrosine hydroxylase staining demonstrate that >70% of LC neurons are absent in the adult with agenesis affecting primarily the dorsal division of the LC. Normally, this division projects noradrenergic efferents to the cortex that appear to be diminished in Ear2-/- since the cortical concentration of noradrenaline is four times lower in these mice. The rostral region of the cortex is known to contain a circadian pacemaker regulating adaptability to light- and restricted food-driven entrainment. In situ hybridization establishes that the circadian expression pattern of the clock gene Period1 is abolished in the Ear2-/- forebrain. Behavioral experiments reveal that Ear2 mutants have a delayed entrainment to shifted light-dark cycles and adapt less efficiently to daytime feeding schedules. We propose that neurons in the dorsal division of LC contribute to the regulation of the forebrain clock, at least in part, through targeted release of noradrenaline into the cortical area.

AB  - Orbital emphysema is a rare condition in the absence of trauma or sinus disease. We report two cases of orbital emphysema caused by sneezing. The patients presented with sudden unilateral eyelid swelling after sneezing. Otorhinolaryngologic and ophthalmic examinations were accompanied by computed tomography (CT). Patient examination disclosed crepitant eyelid swelling, ptosis, and mild unilateral exophthalmos. CT demonstrated areas of emphysema in the orbit. One patient had history of past trauma. The other patient had a history of nasal surgery and concurrent chronic sinusitis. Sneezing may cause orbital emphysema in patients with a history of old periorbital trauma or surgery.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Sneeze is an ubiquitous phenomenon that happens to everyone. In spite of this, little attention has been paid to it, among medical literature in general, and even less in neurologic texts. A curious entity, called autosomal dominant compelling helio-ophthalmic outburst syndrome, has been scarcely described in the scientific literature. This reflex appears when subjects are exposed suddenly to intense sunlight and it consists of long incoercible sneeze bursts. There are no publications on this subject among the spanish literature.and intensity increase with time. OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical and physiological features of the reflex in Spanish families. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Affected subjects were identified by personal interview and given a questionnaire drawn up for this study. Besides, they were instructed to give the questionnaire to their relatives.and intensity increase with time. RESULTS: All the six families showed a high-penetrance, autosomal dominant inheritance. The reflex had a high consistency, a latency about 3 seconds, an intersneeze interval of 2 seconds and a frequency of 2-3 sneezes/ burst. Refractory period was long.and intensity increase with time. DISCUSSION: Our study suggest a higher consistency, shorter latency and lower age of onset of the reflex in our patients than general population, and that frequency and intensity increase with time.

AB  - The photic sneeze response is a well-established clinical phenomenon in which patients respond by sneezing in an uncontrolled manner. This paroxysm of sneezing is evoked by a sudden exposure to an intense or bright light source. The pathogenesis of this response is apparently quite complex. Sudden exposure to bright light involves the optic, oculomotor, and trigeminal nerves, the autonomic nervous system and central brainstem functions. Anecdotal reports have suggested the photic sneezing response may occur as an autosomal dominantly inherited condition. However, such a familial pattern is not always present.

AB  - A national survey of headshaking in 254 horses was undertaken to describe the clinical signs of the condition as observed by horse owners. Principal component analysis was used to determine the underlying structure of 11 signs and the criteria by which the affected horses could be most effectively differentiated; the analysis suggested five components with a variance greater than one which together explained over 60 per cent of the total variance. Other analyses of the data indicated that headshaking could develop at any age and that twice as many males were affected as females; 64 per cent of the horses shook their heads seasonally and geldings were more likely than mares to be seasonally affected. Seasonal headshaking tended to be significantly worse on sunny days but improved on rainy days, windy days, at night and indoors.

AB  - Intractable paroxysmal sneezing is a rare disease primarily affecting teenage girls. We present the case of a 12-year-old girl who demonstrated the classical features of intractable paroxysmal sneezing of psychogenic origin. Most of the reported cases are psychogenic in origin, but a number of other conditions may cause intractable paraoxysmal sneeze. Apart from a detailed history, clinical examination and relevant investigations, topical nasal anaesthesia should be tried for control of symptoms--that will help to differentiate psychogenic sneezing from organic sneezing. A timely diagnosis can avoid unnecessary medical trials, parental anxiety and poor school performance, as most of the patients are very young.

AB  - Four consecutive patients with lateral medullary syndrome reported reversible inability to complete a reflex sneeze, despite retaining the urge to do so and the ability to mimic the motor act. This previously undescribed feature of a relatively common syndrome is in keeping with the known location of a "sneeze center" in the lateral medulla of cat. In man, unilateral brainstem lesion is sufficient to abolish the sneeze reflex temporarily.

AB  - Three rare cases of sudden high frequency sensorineural hearing loss with longitudinal fracture of the stapes footplate are presented. In two patients it occurred after they suppressed a sneeze. In the third patient after the exertion of parturition. At exploratory tympanotomy all were found to have longitudinal fractures of the stapes footplate and two had a perilymph fistula at that site. The history and audiometric profiles in such patients should raise a high index of suspicion regarding the possibility of a stapes footplate fracture.

AB  - Extracellular recordings were made in the dorsal respiratory group (DRG) and adjacent reticular formation following single-shock stimulation of the anterior ethmoidal nerve (AEN) and during sneeze evoked by repetitive stimulation of the AEN in nembutal-anaesthetized, curarized and ventilated cats. These neurones were characterised according to (i) their activity during the respiratory cycle (as inspiratory augmenting or decrementing (I Aug or I Dec), expiratory augmenting or decrementing (E Aug or E Dec), silent or tonic), and (ii) their axonal projection (bulbospinal or non-bulbospinal-non-vagal (BS or NBS-NV)). Following single-shock stimulation of the AEN, most of the inspiratory neurones were transiently inhibited, whereas E Aug neurones were activated and E Dec neurones were activated and then inhibited. Silent neurones responded with a multispike or a paucispike pattern. Following repetitive stimulation of the AEN and during the resulting sneeze reflex, I Aug neurones increased their activity in parallel with the phrenic activity, I Dec neurones fired at the onset and at the end of the inspiration, E Dec and some silent neurones fired either during the compressive phase or after the expulsive phase, whereas E Aug and some silent neurones fired during the expulsive phase. We conclude that sneeze involves a reconfiguration of the central respiratory drive which uses, at least partly, the respiratory network to trigger a non-ventilatory defensive motor act.

AB  - The symptoms of rhinorrhea secondary to influenza and cold virus or seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis are circadian rhythmic. Cough frequency and handkerchief use by persons suffering from virus-induced rhinorrhea are more prominent during the daytime, especially during the initial hours after awakening from nocturnal sleep. The elevation in sublingual temperature as well as the decrement in mental alertness associated with influenza in particular are more profound at this time. Sneezing, blocked nose, and runny nose secondary to allergic rhinitis are also greater in intensity during the morning in approximately 70% of sufferers. The day-night variation in symptom intensity amounts to approximately 20% of the 24-hour mean level. The treatment of these diseases and their symptoms has traditionally involved equal-interval, equal-dose (homeostatic) medication schedules. The effects of antihistamine and antiinflammatory medicines may be enhanced by timing them to the day-night temporal pattern in symptom manifestation and intensity to achieve an optimization of their beneficial effects with control of toxicity, that is, as a chronotherapy.

AB  - Seven horses with headshaking are described. No physical abnormalities were detected in any of the cases. Six of these horses had onset of clinical signs in the spring. The role of light was assessed by application of a blindfold or dark grey lens to the eyes, covering the eyes with a face mask and observing the horse in total darkness outdoors. Cessation of headshaking was observed with blindfolding (5/5 horses), night darkness outdoors (4/4 horses) and use of grey lenses (2/3 horses). Outdoor behaviour suggested efforts to avoid light in 4/4 cases. The photic sneeze in man is suggested as a putative mechanism for equine headshaking. Five of 7 horses had improvement with cyproheptadine treatment (0.3 mg/kg bwt b.i.d.). Headshaking developed within 2 calendar weeks of the same date for 3 consecutive years in one horse. Neuropharmacological alterations associated with photoperiod mechanisms leading to optic trigeminal summation are suggested as possible reasons for spring onset of headshaking.

AB  - A literature review of reported cases of intractable sneezing reveals that intractable sneezing typically occurs in children or adolescents and is a manifestation of conversion disorder. Analysis of these cases demonstrates a number of features that are helpful in differentiating psychogenic from organic sneezing. Also discussed are aspects of patient management once a diagnosis of conversion disorder is established.

AB  - The author presents a case report where, following propofol sedation for a peribulbar block, sneezing was induced once the local anaesthetic needle was placed in the orbital cavity. The physiology of sneezing is discussed, as well as the pathophysiology of the ACHOO (Autosomal Dominant Compelling Helio-Ophthalmic Outburst) syndrome, an autosomal dominant condition, present in approximately 25% of the population, where sneezing is provoked upon exposure to bright light. It is suggested that the anaesthesia induced by propofol may have sensitized patients with this condition to sneeze, since there appeared to be no other excitatory sequelae which have previously been described with propofol.

AB  - Sneezing is a common symptom with numerous causes. Allergic rhinitis is the most common cause of persistent or frequent sneezing. The evaluation of a patient with sneezing should be individualized according to the duration and severity of the symptom. Laboratory tests are not necessary in the majority of patients, since the diagnosis is usually obvious from the history and physical examination. The treatment of persistent or recurring sneezing should be directed at the cause whenever possible. Firm pressure on the nose or lip may be helpful to abort an attack of sneezing.

AB  - Prompted by the observation that a fellow medical student sneezed at about the same time in class every morning, we recorded the time of each of the 118 sneezes she made on 69 days over a 6.5-month period. Analysis of the sneeze times with the goodness-of-fit test revealed a highly nonuniform distribution (p < 0.0001) with a significantly increased probability of sneeze production within a small time interval centered at 8:20 AM. After ruling out the known causes of sneezing, we propose that the subject had a circadian fluctuation in her sneeze threshold independent of any immediate external stimulus. We compare this circadian rhythm to other periodic phenomena such as cyclic esotropia and rapid-cycling bipolar disease as well as to illnesses such as the periodic paralyses in which rapid and reversible changes occur in the neuromuscular system, and we discuss the peculiar circumstances favorable to documenting a circadian sneeze.

AB  - The tendency to sneeze upon exposure to bright light is autosomal dominant and affects 18-35% of the population. This uncontrolled sneezing may represent a danger to pilots during flight. Testing was conducted using Ditric narrow band (+/- 10 nm) interference filters. Wavelengths at 430, 532, and 560 nm were tested with a GE 500-W photoflood BCA #1 bulb at constant intensity. Subsequent testing of military and civilian aviation goggles and sunglasses was conducted using a Digikrom 240 monochromator. Repeated testing with interference filters in a clinical setting showed no effect on sneezing in a susceptible subject. The photic sneeze reflex does not appear to be mediated by specific wavelengths of light, but rather by the change in light intensity. This could trigger an unexpected sneezing episode during critical periods of flight. This is an unrecognized and previously unreported danger to fixed-wing and rotary aircraft pilots.

AB  - The aim of this study was to precise the role of the different trigeminal nerve branches involved in innervation of the nostril in triggering the sneeze reflex. Electrical stimulation of the anterior ethmoidal, posterior nasal and infraorbital nerves was performed in anaesthetized cats. Stimulation of these 3 nerves produced sneezing identical to that induced by mechanical stimulation. Our results emphasize inhibition of the sneeze reflex related to stimulation of the anterior ethmoidal or the posterior nasal nerves by stimulation of the infraorbital nerve.

AB  - The neuronal mechanisms of sneezing were examined in precollicular-postmammillary decerebrate cats. Mechanical stimulation (frequency 20 Hz, peak-to-peak displacement 0.5 mm) of the nasal membrane evoked a series of sneezes. In the same preparation, electrical stimulation (duration 0.2 ms, frequency 10 Hz, 5-50 microA) delivered to the lower brainstem also evoked sneezes. The changes in EMG activity and subglottic pressure during brainstem-induced sneeze were similar to those recorded nasal-induced sneeze. The sneeze-evoking region was located along the ventromedial part of the spinal trigeminal nucleus and the adjacent pontine-medullary lateral reticular formation, and extended rostrocaudally from P4.0 to P14.5 according to the Horsley-Clarke coordinates. These results suggest that the sneeze-evoking region is a distinct structure of the brainstem, having a homogeneous function. This region appears to control the epipharyngeal, intrinsic laryngeal and respiratory muscles. The integrated activity of these muscles underlies the generation of a sneeze.

AB  - Photic induced sneeze is a reflex that occurs in certain individuals after exposure to bright light. Cystinosis is an autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism in which nonprotein cystine accumulates within lysosomes. The pathognomonic ocular manifestation of cystinosis is corneal crystal deposition. We observed photic induced sneezes during ophthalmoscopic examination in five of 19 patients with nephropathic cystinosis (26%). We report on this observation and discuss possible pathophysiological mechanisms for photic induced sneezing in cystinosis.

AB  - Supersensitivity of a muscarinic mechanism is implicated in the pathophysiology of depression. Bright artificial light is efficacious in the treatment of Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). We studied the effect of constant bright light (11,500 lux) on the sensitivity of adult, male rats to oxotremorine, 1.5 mg/kg ip, using a repeated measures design. Oxotremorine challenges were proceeded by the injection of methylscopolamine, 1 mg/kg ip, by 30 minutes. Temperature was telemetrically measured every 10 minutes for 120 minutes starting 10 minutes after the injection of oxotremorine. Prior to and after 7 continuous days of exposure to bright light, the sample exhibited a hypothermic response of 2.50 +/- 0.48 degrees C (mean +/- SEM) and 0.29 +/- 0.31 degrees C (mean +/- SEM), respectively (p less than 0.0014). All 7 animals exhibited blunting to the thermic response to oxotremorine. Bright light also blocked the capacity of amitriptyline to supersensitize a central muscarinic mechanism. Exposure to light at an intensity of 300 lux for 7 days had no effect on the thermic response to oxotremorine. These data are consistent with the hypotheses that the biology of depression involves supersensitivity of central muscarinic mechanisms and that the effects of bright artificial light are not the consequence of shifting circadian rhythms.

AB  - Two cases of inner ear injury caused by suppressed sneezing are described. One patient experienced vestibular symptoms in the form of reflexogenic vertigo that was relieved by surgical section of the tensor tympani tendon. The other patient had a sudden severe permanent sensorineural hearing loss. It is proposed that the aerodynamic pressure increase associated with suppressed sneezing is transmitted via the eustachian tube to cause an implosive fistula of either the round or oval window with injury to the membranous labyrinth.

AB  - A curious monozygous pair of twins producing sudden and vehement nose blowing and/or sneezing during/after eating and drinking, when their stomach had achieved a certain stage of fullness, has been observed. The sneezing reflex could be registered in 4 male members of the family. Since there were neither neurological disorders nor significant alterations in their electroencephalographic activity, the phenomenon may be regarded as a special type of hereditary vegetative sensitivity. The trait seems to follow either an autosomal dominant or perhaps a Y-linked mode of inheritance.

AB  - Four preadolescent children had paroxysms of intractable sneezing. After days of hospitalization and numerous local and systemic drug treatments had failed, a psychogenic cause of their problem was entertained. This uncommon form of conversion reaction most often occurs between the ages of 9 and 15 years, and prognosis is good if the appropriate interventions are undertaken.

AB  - Individual differences with respect to the sneezing reflex are described. Visual exposure to strong light may induce a sneezing reaction in about 20% of the individuals in the Swedish population. Preliminary data indicate that the ' sneezer trait' may be inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. The eventual selective advantage of ST is discussed.

AB  - Sneezes were induced in anestized cats by repetitive stimulation of the ethmoidal nerve. Activity of bulbar respiratory neurons during sneezing was recorded extracellularly through tungsten microelectrodes. Most expiratory neurons could be locked onto the stimulus pulses so that they responded either throughout inspiration as well as expiration or so that they began responding at some time during inspiration. As inspiration approached termination, multiple spiking occurred, finally to result in high-frequency bursts which just preceded active expiration. A fraction of expiratory neurons were activated only in bursts. Latent expiratory neurons were recruited in sneezing. Inspiratory neurons near nucleus ambiguus and most of those near fasciculus solitarius displayed similar response patterns consisting of silent periods followed by delayed smooth activations. Temporal characteristics of the silent periods, "inhibitory gaps," suggested that they resulted from inhibition whose source was the expiratory neurons which were driven throughout inspriation. Some inspiratory neurons in the area of fasciculus solitarius failed to exhibit inhibitory gaps.
